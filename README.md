## Topjava graduate project by Pavel Lezin
----
Design and implement a REST API using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC (or Spring-Boot) **without frontend**.

The task is:

Build a voting system for deciding where to have lunch.

 * 2 types of users: admin and regular users
 * Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
 * Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
 * Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
 * Only one vote counted per user
 * If user votes again the same day:
    - If it is before 11:00 we asume that he changed his mind.
    - If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed

Each restaurant provides new menu each day.

As a result, provide a link to github repository.

It should contain the code and **README.md with API documentation and curl commands for based use-cases to test it..**

-----------------------------
P.S.: Make sure everything works with latest version that is on github :)

P.P.S.: Asume that your API will be used by a frontend developer to build frontend on top of that.

-----------------------------

**View model:**

**Regular user** receives a list of restaurants with today's menu. Restaurants are sorted by rating and name. User can rate the restaurant. User can't edit any other data.

**Admin** receives a full list of restaurants (even without menu) and can edit restaurant's details and can edit today's menu.
